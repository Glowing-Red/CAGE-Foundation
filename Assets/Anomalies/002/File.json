   "Tags": {},

   "Containment Procedure": "Anomaly-002, formerly designated as the **\"Verdant Crop\"** but now titled **\"Verdant Gene\"**, pertains to a unique gene present in the crops grown by the Greenleaf Tribe. The Foundation is to secretly collect and secure all crops containing the Verdant Gene. Following acquisition, [Anomaly-001](../001/Anomaly.html) will be used to erase the memory of the Greenleaf Tribe regarding the Verdant Gene and the Foundation's involvement. No direct genetic manipulation or advanced modification is to be pursued until further discoveries are made.",
   "Description": "Anomaly-002 is a gene located within the crops of the Greenleaf Tribe. This gene significantly enhances the crops' resistance to diseases, pests, and environmental stresses while increasing their nutritional value. These crops exhibit extraordinary resilience and superior nutritional content compared to standard crops, making them highly valuable for agricultural and economic exploitation.",
   "Discovery and Initial Analysis": "Discovered in early 18██ during an ethnobotanical expedition, the Verdant Gene was noted for its exceptional impact on crop performance. Initial field observations and rudimentary analysis revealed the gene’s effects but did not involve advanced genetic modification techniques, as these were not yet developed.",
