   "Containment Procedure": "Anomaly-006, designated as the **\"Growth Soil\"** is to be stored in a secure containment chamber at Site-24. The chamber must be equipped with environmental controls to maintain optimal conditions for the soil. Personnel handling Growth Soil must wear protective gloves and masks to prevent direct contact and contamination.\n2The soil is to be kept in sealed, transparent containers to prevent accidental spillage or misuse. Access to Anomaly-006 is restricted to authorized personnel with Level-3 clearance or higher. Any experiments involving Growth Soil must be approved by Site-24's head researcher and conducted under controlled conditions.",
   "Description": "Growth Soil is a small quantity of soil with unique properties that affect plant growth. The soil appears to be an ordinary, dark brown earth substance but has distinct anomalous effects on plant cultivation.\n2The primary anomalous property of Growth Soil is its ability to significantly enhance the growth speed of plants while simultaneously decreasing their resistance to pests and diseases. Plants grown in Growth Soil exhibit rapid growth but are notably more susceptible to environmental stresses and biological threats. The soil’s effects become evident only after several growth cycles, where the trade-off between growth speed and plant resilience becomes apparent.",
   "Discovery and Initial Analysis": "Anomaly-006 was discovered in a rural village in [REDACTED] during a botanical survey in 18██. The soil was collected due to its unusual, rapid growth effects on plants observed during preliminary tests. Further investigation revealed the soil's increased growth rate and decreased plant resistance.",

These crops retained the increased vitamin content provided by the [Anomaly](002) and showed a level of resistance similar to that of normal crops grown in standard soil. The combination of Growth Soil and [Anomaly](002) effectively balanced rapid growth with improved resilience and enhanced nutritional content."
