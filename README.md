# CAGE Foundation:<br/>
The CAGE Foundation (Capture, Analyze, Guard, Exploit) is an inhumane, profit-hungry organization that was founded in the 1800s.<br/>
The foundation has steadily grown over the centuries through the relentless acquisition and exploitation of anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena.<br/>
Prioritizing profit above all else, the CAGE Foundation utilizes a variety of methods, often unethical and ruthless, to secure and capitalize on these anomalies for maximum gain.<br/>
<br/>
From its inception, the CAGE Foundation has focused on four primary objectives:<br/>
  1. **Capture:** Identify and secure anomalies by any means necessary, often employing force and deception. The foundation spares no expense in its relentless pursuit of these valuable assets.<br/>
  2. **Analyze:** Conduct extensive research and experimentation to understand the properties and potential uses of each anomaly. This often involves rigorous testing, regardless of ethical considerations or human cost.<br/>
  3. **Guard:** Maintain stringent containment protocols to ensure the anomalies remain under the foundation's control. Security measures are continually upgraded to prevent breaches and unauthorized access.<br/>
  4. **Exploit:** Leverage the unique properties of the anomalies for profit and power. This includes selling access, developing new technologies, and manipulating markets and governments to maximize financial returns.<br/>
<br/>
The foundation's activities are shrouded in secrecy, with its operations conducted in hidden facilities around the globe.<br/>
Despite numerous ethical and moral controversies, and numerous shell and dummy corporations, The CAGE Foundation remains unchallenged in its quest for dominance, driven by an insatiable appetite for profit and power.<br/>
